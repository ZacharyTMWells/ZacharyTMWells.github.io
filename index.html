								<h2>Overview</h2>
							</header>

							<p>This page will document the creation of a prosthetic like arm through the use of different technology such as 3D scanning, 3D printing, CAD and resin casting</p>
							<headder>
								<h2>AIM</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>The aim of this project is the creation of prosthetic like arm that will have a mechanism for elbow movement and silicone synthetic skin panels on the forearm and bicep. In addition, the hand of the arm will be removable allowing for different hand options to be swapped into its place</p>

								<h2>Stage 1: 3D Scanning</h2>
							</header>

							<p>3D Scanning. 3D scanning is the process of collecting shape and texture data of a phisical object to then recreate that object digitally</p>

							<p>Stage 1 is the 3D scanning of an arm to then be used as a size reference for the upcoming endoskeleton that will made in the future. the model shown below has had to be decimated using blender due to file size restrictions on this platform</p>
							<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/ZacharyTMWells/ZacharyTMWells.github.io/main/images/armdec.stl?height=840"></script>
							<p>To 3D scan the arm we utilised a camera based 3D scanner that allowed us to have a accurate model of my arm that would then allow us to begin working on the design for the mechanism.</p><br>
							<p>After scanning the model was decimated in blender to reduce the file size of the model this allowed for it to both be easier to work with and allow me to upload it to GitHub</p>

								<h2>Stage 2: Moddeling</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>Stage 2 is the manipulation of the 3D scanned model in Autodesk Fusion 360</p><br>
							<p>3D Moddeling. 3D Moddeling is the process of digitally creating an object by the manipulation of polygons to create shapes</p>
							<p>By using Autodesk Fusion 360 we can vary easily both import the arm model and create functional designs</p><br>
							<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/ZacharyTMWells/ZacharyTMWells.github.io/main/images/rdam_v1.stl?height=840"></script><br>
							<p>Above is the splitting of the model and the removal of the aria that the mechanism will be located the connection scheme also depicted by the rings next to the meshes that will then be attached to the meshes themselves</p><br>
							<p>Below is the mechanism that will make up the elbow joint and the attached connectors along with the hollowing of the model to make the next step of the process both easier and cheaper, During the designing of the mechanism i opted to use spur gears to translate the motion of one section of the arm to the other with corresponding teeth on each base plate allowing the motion of one part of the arm rotate the spur gears which would then move the elbow mid-section around the baseplate of the other section of the arm, doing  this way allowed for 180 degrees of motion instead of the 90 that you would get from a singular joint.</p><br>

							<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/ZacharyTMWells/ZacharyTMWells.github.io/main/images/rdam_v6.stl?height=840"></script><br>
							<p>The additional functionality built into Fusion allowed for the quick creation of highly accurate spur gears that can then be utilised in the project <br> This unlike other 3D modelling software like blender that doesn’t have such built-in tools, but we also have to bear in mind that though the two software’s are vary similar having almost the same capability’s the specialise in different industry’s one being industrial design the other being games/graphical design</p><br>

								<h2>Stage 3: 3D Printing</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>Stage 3 is the process of 3D printing the mechanism and the arm sections</p>
							<p>FDM 3D printing is the process of melting a filament and then extruding it onto a print bead in layers to then make up a solid object</p>
							<p>The Use of a standard FDM or Fused deposition modelling 3D printer allowed me to take the CAD file and turn it into reality. To make 3D printing easier when making the CAD file i made it so the majority of components where flat allowing for multiple shorter easier prints, Though the downside to this is that some assembly is required after printing.</p>

								</div>
							</div>
							<p>Due to some issues with the 3D printer used the layers of the larger prints from the side don't look as good as hoped this could be down to poor extrusion or too much play in the printers frame causing it to unexpectedly shift.<br>This could be remedied by better maintenance of the printer or the use of a different printer. <br>Another issue present is the stringing that has occurred, this is an issue with the retraction settings of the printer and can be fixed with proper calibration</p>

								<h2>Additional Technologies</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>In addition to the technologies used above, others where considered for the project some that would be used in future developments and others that wouldn’t suit the project</p>
							<headder>
								<h2>Resin Printing</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>Resin 3D printing was looked at however it was deemed unsuitable for this project as the items created by a resin printer though high in detail are limited by the build volume of the printer</p>
							<headder>
								<h2>Silicone Casting</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>Another technology looked at was silicone and resin casting. By using silicone we would have be able to add a synthetic skin to the arm, this idea however would have to be scrapped due to time constraints and delays causing the use of silicone to become unfeasible, it would however be something that i would like to have a look at attempting in the future. </p>
							<headder>
								<h2>Haptic Pen</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>During the modeling stage of the project we could have used the haptic pen to edit the 3D scanned model, however due to the model needing to be decimated there was no point in adding extra detail plus the model was already in an acceptable state alreadyDuring the modelling stage of the project we could have used the haptic pen to edit the 3D scanned model, however due to the model needing to be decimated there was no point in adding extra detail plus the model was already in an acceptable state already</p>

								<h2>Next Steps</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>If future work was to happen on the project one aria that would be looked at would be strengthening the joint mechanism, this would require a redesign and during the redesign i would also remedy issues with the current design, replacing the three connecting sections to one long bar as due to the three sections the mechanism doesn’t work as intended</p>
							<p>Another aria that would be looked at would be going back to the idea of having a synthetic skin made out of silicone</p>
							<p>A third aria that would be looked at would be the forearm sections and the bicep sections re-shelling and redesigning the panel sections</p>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/1500x500.jpeg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I am a student at Staffordshire university, i am currently studying Artificial intelligence and Robotics. My personal interest is in smart prosthesis and wish to produce a robotic hand that utilises 3D printing and of the shelf hardware to reduce it cost whilst increasing the capability of the hand. Recently with a group from my university I spent a month in Vietnam more specifically Hanoi city immersing myself in the environment and the culture, Vietnam is a beautiful country that I would love to go back to(image above from my time in Vietnam).</p>
