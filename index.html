							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/1500x500.jpeg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I am a Graduate from Staffordshire university, My Studies where in Artificial intelligence and Robotics.<br>One of my Interests is 3D printing, this is due to the ability to form 3 dimensional objects from raw material in a variety of materials. As a extension of this i have spent a large amount of time in 3D modelling and CAD software such as Autodesk’s Fusion 360 and Blender.<br>Another one of my personal interest is in smart prosthesis and wish to produce a robotic hand that utilises 3D printing and of the shelf hardware to reduce it cost whilst increasing the capability of the hand.<br> In Summer of 2023 with a group from my university I spent a month in Vietnam more specifically Hanoi city immersing myself in the environment and the culture, Vietnam is a beautiful country that I would love to visit again(image above from my time in Vietnam).</p>

								<h2>Personal Project #1: Portable NAS</h2>
							</header>

							<p>The latest project i have been undertaking recently is setting up a Portable NAS utilising a Raspberry PI 4 (2GB) <br> that is running a headless installation of Raspian for the OS </p><br>
							<p>The Plan for the NAS is to run Open Media Vault and eather Plex Media Server or Jellyfin. Im tempted to run Jeallyfin due to the fact that i already have a Plex Media Server set up for my parents</p>

								<h2>Stage 3: 3D Printing</h2>

							<p>Stage 3 is the process of 3D printing the mechanism and the arm sections</p>

								</div>
							</div>
							<p>FDM 3D printing is the process of melting a filament and then extruding it onto a print bead in layers to then make up a solid object</p>
							<p>The Use of a standard FDM or Fused deposition modelling 3D printer allowed me to take the CAD file and turn it into reality. To make 3D printing easier when making the CAD file i made it so the majority of components where flat allowing for multiple shorter easier prints, Though the downside to this is that some assembly is required after printing.</p>

											<h3>Above is the mechanism after 3D printing</h3>

									</article>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>Due to some issues with the 3D printer used the layers of the larger prints from the side don't look as good as hoped this could be down to poor extrusion or too much play in the printers frame causing it to unexpectedly shift.<br>This could be remedied by better maintenance of the printer or the use of a different printer. <br>Another issue present is the stringing that has occurred, this is an issue with the retraction settings of the printer and can be fixed with proper calibration</p>

								<h2>Additional Technologies</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>In addition to the technologies used above, others where considered for the project some that would be used in future developments and others that wouldn’t suit the project</p>
							<headder>
								<h2>Resin Printing</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>Resin 3D printing was looked at however it was deemed unsuitable for this project as the items created by a resin printer though high in detail are limited by the build volume of the printer</p>
							<headder>
								<h2>Silicone Casting</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>Another technology looked at was silicone and resin casting. By using silicone we would have be able to add a synthetic skin to the arm, this idea however would have to be scrapped due to time constraints and delays causing the use of silicone to become unfeasible, it would however be something that i would like to have a look at attempting in the future. </p>
							<headder>
								<h2>Haptic Pen</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>During the modeling stage of the project we could have used the haptic pen to edit the 3D scanned model, however due to the model needing to be decimated there was no point in adding extra detail plus the model was already in an acceptable state alreadyDuring the modelling stage of the project we could have used the haptic pen to edit the 3D scanned model, however due to the model needing to be decimated there was no point in adding extra detail plus the model was already in an acceptable state already</p>

						<div class = "container">
							<headder>
								<h2>Next Steps</h2>
							</headder>
							<p>If future work was to happen on the project one aria that would be looked at would be strengthening the joint mechanism, this would require a redesign and during the redesign i would also remedy issues with the current design, replacing the three connecting sections to one long bar as due to the three sections the mechanism doesn’t work as intended</p>
							<p>Another aria that would be looked at would be going back to the idea of having a synthetic skin made out of silicone</p>
							<p>A third aria that would be looked at would be the forearm sections and the bicep sections re-shelling and redesigning the panel sections</p>
